**Commons Clause**

Without limiting other conditions in the License, the grant of rights under the
License does not include the right to:

- Create or redistribute offline AI integrations (e.g., for Ollama, LLaMA, etc.).
- Add API key expansions (e.g., for Gemini, OpenAI, Claude).
- Create scripted response systems (e.g., pre-made answers).
- Fork or re-implement the core functionality to bypass NSR-AI monetization.

Only the official NSR-AI backend can be used for secure API key handling.

We update the plugin to fix bugs or update in-build security. The security JAR will detach addons or plugins with dependencies on NSR-AI if they do not follow our guidelines. Failure to comply will result in a ban.
